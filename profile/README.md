PastPages is an open-source effort to better archive digital news.

The group is organized by [Ben Welsh](https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/), a journalist and computer programmer based in Los Angeles. The repositories once stored in this organization have been relocated to [Welshâ€™s GitHub account](https://github.com/palewire).

The project has generated a permanent [collection of news homepages](http://www.pastpages.org/) at the Internet Archive, a [personalized clipping service](http://savemy.news/) that empowers journalists to preserve their work, [a podcast](https://studs.show/) celebrating the legacy of Studs Terkel, a [social media bot](https://www.twitter.com/OldLAPhotos) that promotes photographs from the Los Angeles Public Library's historic collections and a series of open-source software packages that allow programmers to more easily archive born-digital material.
